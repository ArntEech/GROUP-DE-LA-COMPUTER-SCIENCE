# üß† Day 11 - True/False Quiz Game (OOP & Modular Programming)

## üéØ Objective:
Build a console-based **True or False Quiz Game** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **modular code structure**. The app will display a series of questions, accept user answers, track scores, and give feedback.

---

## üìÅ Folder Structure

+ You must create a folder called: Execise31

+ Inside that folder, create the ff 4 seperate files.:
     - Main file: Main entry point to start the quiz
     - QuizBrain file: Manages quiz flow and logic
     - Question file: Holds the structure of a Question
     - Data file: Stores quiz question data


---

## üß© Module Responsibilities

---

### ‚úÖ 1. `question_model` (Question Structure)

This module defines the blueprint or structure for a **quiz question**.

#### üîß What to include:
- A **class or object template** called `Question`
- It should have two properties:
  - `text` ‚Üí the question text
  - `answer` ‚Üí the correct answer
- A **constructor** that accepts two parameters:
  - The question text
  - The correct answer
- These should be stored in the object's internal properties

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `data` (Question List)

This module holds a collection of **predefined quiz questions**.

#### üîß Use this default set of questions: (Change the syntax to meet your programming language equivalent
```python
question_data = [
    {"text": "A slug's blood is green.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "The loudest animal is the African Elephant.", "answer": "False"},
    {"text": "Approximately one quarter of human bones are in the feet.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "The total surface area of a human lungs is the size of a football pitch.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "In West Virginia, USA, if you accidentally hit an animal with your car, you are free to take it home to eat.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "In London, UK, if you happen to die in the House of Parliament, you are entitled to a state funeral.", "answer": "False"},
    {"text": "It is illegal to pee in the Ocean in Portugal.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "You can lead a cow down stairs but not up stairs.", "answer": "False"},
    {"text": "Google was originally called 'Backrub'.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "Buzz Aldrin's mother's maiden name was 'Moon'.", "answer": "True"},
    {"text": "No piece of square dry paper can be folded in half more than 7 times.", "answer": "False"},
    {"text": "A few ounces of chocolate can to kill a small dog.", "answer": "True"}
]
```

### ‚úÖ 3. `quiz_brain` (Quiz Logic Handler)

This module will manage the core quiz functionality, including:

+ Tracking the number of questions answered

+ Asking each question

+ Checking if the user is correct

+ Keeping score

#### üîß Include the following:
- A **class** or **function** module named `QuizBrain` or similar
- It internally track:
  - `current_question_index` 
  - `score`
  - `question_list` (filled with the question objects)
    
#### üîÑ Required Methods/Functions:
1. `still_has_questions()`
   - Returns `True` if there are more questions to ask and `False` otherwise
2. `next_question()`
   - Retrieves the next question and prompts the user
3. `check_answer(user_input, correct_answer)`
   - Compares the user‚Äôs input to the correct answer
   - Updates the score if correct
   - Provides feedback

### ‚úÖ 4. main (Quiz Entry Point)
This is where your application starts. It will:
+ Import/require the other modules
+ Transform each dictionary in the `question_data` list into a `Question` object
+ Store all `Question` objects in a list or array
+ Create an instance of your `quiz_brain` class
+ Loop through questions using the methods you've defined
+ Print the final score at the end

### üåê Language-Agnostic Notes
This project can be implemented in any **object-oriented** or **structured programming language**, such as:
+ Python
+ Java
+ JavaScript
+ C++
+ C#
+ Dart
+ Ruby

The key concepts to apply:
+ Use classes or objects to encapsulate logic and data
+ Use methods/functions for behavior
+ Use arrays/lists/collections for storing the questions

### üí• Bonus Ideas (Optional):

+ Filter questions by difficulty (easy, medium, hard)
+ Add a timer for each question
+ Save high scores to a file or database
+ Pull live quiz questions from an API
    
üéØ Goal: Apply OOP principles, modular programming, and clean user interaction

Happy coding! üíªüí°
