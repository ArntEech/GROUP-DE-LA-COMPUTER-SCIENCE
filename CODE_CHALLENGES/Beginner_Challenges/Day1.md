# 🌟 DAY ONE - Programming Basics 🌟

⚠️ Notice: Keep It Simple!

🔹 Use only basic programming skills—avoid loops, functions, or advanced techniques.
🔹 Focus on understanding syntax and core concepts before moving forward.


## 🚀 Exercise 1 - Printing  
📌 **Instructions:**  
Write a program to display the output below **exactly as it is**:  

Day 1 - Output Function  
The function is declared like this:  
print('what to print')

📝 **Hint**: Research how to display text in your chosen programming language

'''

## 🔍 Exercise 2 - Debugging 
📌 **Instructions:**  
The code below has **several errors**. Fix them so the program runs correctly in your chosen programming language.  


DISPLAY "Day 1 - String Manipulation  
DISPLAY "String Concatenation is done with the + sign.  
     DISPLAY 'e.g. DISPLAY("Hello " + "world")  
DISPLAY "New lines can be created with a backslash and n.  

🛠 What to fix?
✅ Syntax errors (e.g., missing/incorrect symbols, mismatched quotes)
✅ Function names (e.g., replace DISPLAY with the correct output function)
✅ Formatting issues

📝 **Hint**: Look up how to print output correctly in your programming language.


## 🎭 Exercise 3 - Inputs & String Length  
📌 **Instructions:**  
Write a program that **counts the number of characters** in a user’s name.  

**Example:**  

🔹 **Input:** `Natsu Dragneel`  
🔹 **Output:** `13` _(since spaces count as characters)_  

📝 **Hint:** Research how to **read user input** and **count characters** in your programming language.  

---  

## 🔄 Exercise 4 - Swapping Variables  
📌 **Instructions:**  
Write a program that **switches** the values stored in the variables `a` and `b`.  

**Example:**  

🔹 **Input:** `a = 3, b = 4`  
🔹 **Output:** `a = 4, b = 3`  

📝 **Hint:** Explore **swapping techniques** like **arithmetic operations** or built-in methods in your programming language.  

---  

## 🛠 Your Task  
🔹 **Copy and paste the code below** into your workspace.  
🔹 **Modify only the syntax** to match your programming language.  
🔹 **Do not change the functionality.**  

# Don't change the code below 
a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")
# Don't change the code above
