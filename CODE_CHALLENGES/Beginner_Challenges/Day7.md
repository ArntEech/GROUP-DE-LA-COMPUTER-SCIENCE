# 🎯 **DAY SEVEN - FUNCTIONS WITH INPUT**  

## 🎨 **Exercise 25 - Paint Area Calculator**  

### 📝 **Instructions:**  

🖌️ You are painting a wall, and the instructions on the **paint can** state:  

🔹 **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall**.  

🔹 Given the **height** and **width** of the wall, calculate how many cans of paint you need.

🔹 Since you can't buy **half a can**, always **round up** to the nearest whole number.  

### 📏 **Formula:**  

+ number of cans = (wall height * wall width) / coverage per can.  

+ e.g Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5

+ number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = 1.6

+ But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans(which is the nearest whole number). 

### 🖥️ **Example:**  

✅ **Input:**  

Height of wall: 3  

Width of wall: 9  

✅ Output:

You'll need 5 cans of paint. 🏠🎨

+ **NB:** The name of the function and parameters must match those on the starting code for the code to function properly.

**Starting Code:**

-- You solution should be below this line --








-- You solution should be above this line --

test_h = Input("Height of wall: ") //Type the syntax equivalent of your programming language

test_w = Input("Width of wall: ") //Type the syntax equivalent of your programming language

coverage = 5 

paint_calc(height = test_h, width = test_w, cover = coverage) 

*🔄 Don't change the function name or parameters! Just modify it to match your programming language syntax.*
