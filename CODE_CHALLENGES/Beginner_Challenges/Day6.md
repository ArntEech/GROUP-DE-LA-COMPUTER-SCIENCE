# 🌟 DAY SIX - Functions and Loops 🌟

⚠️ Notice: In these exercises, use functions and loops to make your code efficient.

## 🔄 Exercise 20 - Even or Odd Checker

**📌 Instructions:**

Write a function that checks whether a number is even or odd.

🔹 The function should:

Accept an integer as input.

Print "Even Number" if it is even.

Print "Odd Number" if it is odd.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

Enter a number: 7  

🔹 Output:

Odd Number  

📝 Hint: Use the modulus (%) operator to determine even and odd numbers.

## 🔢 Exercise 21 - Sum of All Numbers

**📌 Instructions:**

Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N, where N is given by the user.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number N as input.

Use a loop to sum all numbers from 1 to N.

Print the final sum.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

Enter a number: 5  

🔹 Output:

The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15  

📝 Hint: Use a for or while loop to iterate through the numbers.


## ✨ Exercise 22 - Multiplication Table Generator

**📌 Instructions:**

Write a function that prints the multiplication table for a given number.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number N as input.

Print the multiplication table for N from 1 to 10.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

Enter a number: 3  

🔹 Output:

3 x 1 = 3  

3 x 2 = 6  

3 x 3 = 9  
...  
3 x 10 = 30  

📝 Hint: Use a loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and multiply by N.


## 🔢 Exercise 23 - Count the Digits

**📌 Instructions:**

Write a function that counts how many digits are in a given number.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number as input.

Count the total digits in that number.

Print the count.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

Enter a number: 5478  

🔹 Output:

The number 5478 has 4 digits.  

📝 Hint: Convert the number to a string or use a loop to count digits.


## 🔠 Exercise 24 - Reverse a String

**📌 Instructions:**

Write a function that reverses a given string and prints it.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a string as input.

Reverse the string.

Print the reversed string.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

Enter a word: Python  

🔹 Output:

Reversed word: nohtyP  

📝 Hint: Use slicing ([::-1]) or a loop to reverse the string.

🚀 Good luck, and keep practicing functions and loops! 🎯
