# DAY FOUR -  Randomisation and Arrays/lists

## Exercise 13 - Heads or Tails

📌 **Instructions:**

+ You are going to write a virtual coin toss program.

+ It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".

+ The first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g Heads, not heads

+ You should generate a random number, either 0 or 1

+ Then use that number to print out Heads or Tails
  


## Exercise 14 - Banker Roulette

📌 **Instructions:**

+ You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names.

+ The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.


**Example:**

+ Input:

Micheal, Revic, Arnold, Stephannie, Philipa

+ Output:

Revic is going to buy the meal today!



## Exercise 15 - Treasure Map.

📌 **Instructions:**

+ Write a program which will mark a spot with an X on a map.

+ The map is made of 3 rows of blank squares.

              
 ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

 ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

 ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

+ Your program should allow you to enter the position of the treasure using a two-digit system.

+ The first digit is the horizontal column number and the second digit is the vertical row number

+ This is for a 3 X 3 Matrix

**Example:** 

+ Input:

e.g column 2, row 3 would be entered as: 23

+ Output:

["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

["⬜️", 'X', "⬜️"]

**Starting Code**: (Type your programming language equivalent of the code)

row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]

map = [row1, row2, row3]

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")

position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
