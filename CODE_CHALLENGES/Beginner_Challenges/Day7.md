# DAY SEVEN - FUNCTIONS WITH INPUT


## Exercise 25 - Paint Area Calculator

**Instructions:**

+ Your are painting a wall. The instructions on the *paint can* says that, *1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall*.

+ Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

+ number of cans = (wall height * wall width) / coverage per can.

+ e.g Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5 

+ number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = 1.6

+ But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans(which is the nearest whole number).

+ **NB:** The name of the function and parameters must match those on the starting code for the code to function properly.

**Example:**

+ Input :

Height of wall: 3

Width of wall: 9

+ Output:

You'll need 5 cans of paint.

**Starting Code:**

-- You solution should be below this line --








-- You solution should be above this line --

test_h = Input("Height of wall: ") //Type the syntax equivalent of your programming language

test_w = Input("Width of wall: ") //Type the syntax equivalent of your programming language

coverage = 5 

paint_calc(height = test_h, width = test_w, cover = coverage) // Don't change the name of the function or the parameters given but rather modify this code to match the syntax by which you call functions/methods in your programming language.



# Exercise 26 - Prime Number Checker

**Instructions:**

+ Write a function/method that chects whether if a number passed into it is a prime number or not.

+ Use this link to learn more on prime numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime number.

**Starting Code:**

-- You solution should be below this line --








-- You solution should be above this line --
n = Input("Check this number: ")
prime_checker(number = n) //use the same instructions in exercise 25 regarding the named function.
