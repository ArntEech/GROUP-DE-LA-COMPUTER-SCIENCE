🌟 DAY SIX - Functions and Loops 🌟
⚠️ Notice: In these exercises, use functions and loops to make your code efficient.

🔄 Exercise 13 - Even or Odd Checker
📌 Instructions:
Write a function that checks whether a number is even or odd.

🔹 The function should:

Accept an integer as input.

Print "Even Number" if it is even.

Print "Odd Number" if it is odd.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

css
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 7  
🔹 Output:

javascript
Copy
Edit
Odd Number  
📝 Hint: Use the modulus (%) operator to determine even and odd numbers.

🔢 Exercise 14 - Sum of All Numbers
📌 Instructions:
Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N, where N is given by the user.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number N as input.

Use a loop to sum all numbers from 1 to N.

Print the final sum.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

css
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 5  
🔹 Output:

python
Copy
Edit
The sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15  
📝 Hint: Use a for or while loop to iterate through the numbers.

✨ Exercise 15 - Multiplication Table Generator
📌 Instructions:
Write a function that prints the multiplication table for a given number.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number N as input.

Print the multiplication table for N from 1 to 10.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

css
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 3  
🔹 Output:

python-repl
Copy
Edit
3 x 1 = 3  
3 x 2 = 6  
3 x 3 = 9  
...  
3 x 10 = 30  
📝 Hint: Use a loop to iterate from 1 to 10 and multiply by N.

🔢 Exercise 16 - Count the Digits
📌 Instructions:
Write a function that counts how many digits are in a given number.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a number as input.

Count the total digits in that number.

Print the count.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 5478  
🔹 Output:

typescript
Copy
Edit
The number 5478 has 4 digits.  
📝 Hint: Convert the number to a string or use a loop to count digits.

🔠 Exercise 17 - Reverse a String
📌 Instructions:
Write a function that reverses a given string and prints it.

🔹 The function should:

Accept a string as input.

Reverse the string.

Print the reversed string.

🧩 Example:

🔹 Input:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Enter a word: Python  
🔹 Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Reversed word: nohtyP  
📝 Hint: Use slicing ([::-1]) or a loop to reverse the string.

🚀 Good luck, and keep practicing functions and loops! 🎯
