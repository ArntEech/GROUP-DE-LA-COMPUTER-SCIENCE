# 🎨 Day 12 - Programming with Graphics

Welcome to **Day 12** of our Intermediate Programming Journey! 🚀  
Today, we move from console-based programs to **programming with graphics**.  
You will begin creating drawings and visual outputs using **graphical modules or libraries** available in your programming language.

# ✏️ Exercise 32 - Draw a Square

## 📝 Instructions:

- Your task is to **draw a perfect square** using the **graphics module** or **drawing library** available in your programming language.  
- The square should have **four equal sides** and **right angles** (90 degrees at each corner).

## 🌐 Guidance:

- 📚 **Research and read the official documentation** of your chosen language’s graphics or drawing library.
- 🛠️ Find how to:
  - Move your graphic object **forward** a certain distance.
  - **Rotate/turn** your graphic object by a specific angle.
- 🖍️ You can choose any color or drawing speed.

## 💡 Notes:

- You **should not** print to the console — this challenge is about **visual drawing**.
- The focus is on using **commands to move** and **rotate** your drawing object.
- **Examples of graphics libraries you can use:**
  - Python: `turtle`
  - JavaScript: `p5.js`, `Canvas API`
  - Java: `Graphics2D`
  - C++: `SFML`, `SDL`
  - C#: `System.Drawing`
  - Swift: `UIKit`, `CoreGraphics`

✅ Draw the square using the proper graphical commands for your language.  
✅ The square must appear visually on the screen or drawing canvas.

# ✏️ Exercise 33 - Draw a Dashed Line

## 📝 Instructions:

- Your task is to **draw a dashed (broken) horizontal line** using the **graphics module** or **drawing library** available in your programming language.
- The dashed line should consist of **multiple short visible segments** separated by **invisible gaps**.

## 🌐 Guidance:

- 📚 **Research how to:**
  - Move the drawing object forward while **drawing a visible line**.
  - Temporarily **stop drawing** (i.e., lift the pen/disable drawing).
  - Move forward again **without drawing** (create a gap).
  - Resume **drawing again** after the gap.
- 🔁 Repeat this pattern multiple times (about 15 dashes recommended).

✅ Your dashed line must appear visually on the screen or drawing canvas.  
✅ Dashes and gaps should look balanced and uniform.

# ✏️ Exercise 34 - Draw Overlaid Shapes

## 📝 Instructions:

- Your task is to **draw multiple different regular polygons** (shapes) overlaid on each other using your **graphics module** or **drawing library**.
- The shapes you need to draw:
  - Triangle (3 sides)
  - Square (4 sides)
  - Pentagon (5 sides)
  - Hexagon (6 sides)
  - Heptagon (7 sides)
  - Octagon (8 sides)
  - Nonagon (9 sides)
  - Decagon (10 sides)

- **Requirements:**
  - Each shape must have a **different pen color**.
  - All shapes should be **overlaid (drawn on the same center or origin)** without moving the base position.

## 🌐 Guidance:

- 📚 **Research:**
  - How to change **pen or stroke color**.
  - How to draw polygons by moving forward and turning by a certain angle.
  - **Hint:**  
    The angle to turn for each shape = `360 ÷ number of sides`.
    - Example: A square has 4 sides → `360 ÷ 4 = 90 degrees` turn at each corner.
- 🔄 For each shape:
  - Change the color.
  - Loop through the correct number of sides.
  - Move forward and turn accordingly.

## 🎯 Reference Output:

Your final drawing should look similar to this:

✅ Focus on **movement, rotation, color changing, and shape logic**.

✅ Make sure your graphics canvas or screen stays open after drawing so you can view your work.
