# 🎨 Day 12 - Programming with Graphics

Welcome to **Day 12** of our Intermediate Programming Journey! 🚀  
Today, we move from console-based programs to **programming with graphics**.  
You will begin creating drawings and visual outputs using **graphical modules or libraries** available in your programming language.

# ✏️ Exercise 32 - Draw a Square

## 📝 Instructions:

- Your task is to **draw a perfect square** using the **graphics module** or **drawing library** available in your programming language.  
- The square should have **four equal sides** and **right angles** (90 degrees at each corner).

## 🌐 Guidance:

- 📚 **Research and read the official documentation** of your chosen language’s graphics or drawing library.
- 🛠️ Find how to:
  - Move your graphic object **forward** a certain distance.
  - **Rotate/turn** your graphic object by a specific angle.
- 🖍️ You can choose any color or drawing speed.

## 💡 Notes:

- You **should not** print to the console — this challenge is about **visual drawing**.
- The focus is on using **commands to move** and **rotate** your drawing object.
- **Examples of graphics libraries you can use:**
  - Python: `turtle`
  - JavaScript: `p5.js`, `Canvas API`
  - Java: `Graphics2D`
  - C++: `SFML`, `SDL`
  - C#: `System.Drawing`
  - Swift: `UIKit`, `CoreGraphics`

✅ Draw the square using the proper graphical commands for your language.  
✅ The square must appear visually on the screen or drawing canvas.

# ✏️ Exercise 33 - Draw a Dashed Line

## 📝 Instructions:

- Your task is to **draw a dashed (broken) horizontal line** using the **graphics module** or **drawing library** available in your programming language.
- The dashed line should consist of **multiple short visible segments** separated by **invisible gaps**.

## 🌐 Guidance:

- 📚 **Research how to:**
  - Move the drawing object forward while **drawing a visible line**.
  - Temporarily **stop drawing** (i.e., lift the pen/disable drawing).
  - Move forward again **without drawing** (create a gap).
  - Resume **drawing again** after the gap.
- 🔁 Repeat this pattern multiple times (about 15 dashes recommended).

✅ Your dashed line must appear visually on the screen or drawing canvas.  
✅ Dashes and gaps should look balanced and uniform.
